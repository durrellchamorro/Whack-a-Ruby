# Whack a Ruby

This is a little command-line game I built with [Gosu].
To play it just:
```sh
$ bundle install
```
```sh
$ ruby whack_a_ruby.rb
```
Have fun whacking the ruby image as it appears in random places on your screen.
If you get 10 whacks or more, you may proceed to the next of three levels.
Each level gets a little harder and has its own song from the soundtrack
