# Whack a Ruby

This is a little command-line game I built with [Gosu].
To play it just:
```sh
$ bundle install
```
```sh
$ ruby whack_a_ruby.rb
```
Have fun whacking the ruby image as it appears in random places on your screen while you listen to "This Book is Made (of Rabbits and Lemonade)" from the soundtrack to *Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby*.
